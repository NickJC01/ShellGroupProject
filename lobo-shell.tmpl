               ==========

---- EXPLORE THE PROBLEM ----

>> A1: To open a file for I/O re-direction requires various flags

>> example shell and list the parameters used in
>>     open(bar,...)
>> for each of these scenarios:
>>   (i) foo > bar = open("bar", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644);
>>  (ii) foo < bar = open("bar", O_RDONLY);
>> (iii) foo >> bar = open("bar", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_APPEND, 0644);

   (i) foo > bar = open("bar", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, 0644);
  (ii) foo < bar = open("bar", O_RDONLY);
 (iii) foo >> bar = open("bar", O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_APPEND, 0644);


>> A2: Create scenarios to test and describe how bash behaves in
>> each of these scenarios:
>>   (i) foo < bar, when "bar" does not exist?
>>  (ii) foo < bar, when "bar" exists but you lack permission to read it?
>> (iii) foo > bar, when "bar" exists but you lack permission to write it?
>>  (iv) foo > bar, when "bar" cannot be created?
>> In each case, give the commands you used to create and evaluate 
>> the scenario.

  (i) foo < bar, when "bar" does not exist?
  Test: cat < no_such_file
  Output: bash: no_such_file: No such file or directory

  (ii) foo < bar, when "bar" exists but you lack permission to read it?
  Test: touch bar
        chmod 000 bar
        cat < bar
  Output: bash: bar: Permission denied

  (iii) foo > bar, when "bar" exists but you lack permission to write it?
  Test: touch bar
        chmod 444 bar
        echo hello > bar
  Output: bash: bar: Permission denied
  (iv) foo > bar, when "bar" cannot be created?
  Test: mkdir readonly_dir
        chmod 555 readonly_dir
        echo hello > readonly_dir/bar
  Output: bash: readonly_dir/bar: Permission denied

>> A3: Unix pipes allow synchronization among processes to facilitate
>> interprocess communication (IPC). Consider a pipeline of arbitrary
>> length, like:
>>     P[0] | P[1] | ... | P[i-1] | P[i] | P[i+1] | ... | P[n]
>> Imagine a loop, like:
>>     for i in 0 .. n: 
>>         set-up-pipeline-for( process P[i] )
>> What prior-created pipes would be used with process P[i]?
>> What new pipes need to be created to set up P[i]'s pipeline?

The pipe created by P[i-1], which it wrote to, would be used in P[i]
to read from. If P[i] is followed by a |, it would need
to create a new pipe to write to.

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A4: Copy here the declaration of each new `struct',
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

None of the above types were created.

// it extracts one process's words from lWords
// starting at lIndex and puts them in pWords.

// (storing it in pipes[numPipes]), and execs according to words. 
void forkAndExecRDWR(char *words[], int *pipes[], int numPipes);

// Given pipes[], the list of all created pipes, and numPipes, this function
// loops through pipes[0] to pipes[numPipes - 1], closing both ends of the pipe
// and freeing them.
void closeAllPipes(int *pipes[], int numPipes);

// Given words[], the words used to call the process, this function detects 
// stdin and stdout overrides, executes them, and removes the override tokens
// from words so it can be used in any of the forkAndExec functions.
void handleRedirects(char *words[]);

// Given words[], this function removes the override tokens
// from words so it can be used in any of the forkAndExec functions.
// It is called in handleRedirects()
void remove_redirect_tokens(char *words[], int index);

// Replaces phrases within quotes with a single string with quotes
// removed. Words are separated by a comma.
void replaceQuotes(char *words[]);

// Replaces words at start through end index with newStr.
void replace_section(char *words[], int start, int end, char *newStr);

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A6: Briefly describe how the functions (from A3) are called
>> when your shell is processing the user-entered commands:
>>   foo 1 2 | bar 3 4

First, getProcessWords() is called in the parent to extract foo 1 2.
Because getProcessWords() ended on a pipe but no pipes to read from
have been created yet, forkAndExecWr() is called to exec foo. Within
forkAndExecWr(), handleRedirects() is called to search for and <, > or
>> and override stdin or stdout if needed, but it is not. replaceQuotes()
is also called but has no effect. forkAndExecWr() calls closeAllPipes() 
before exec().

Then, getProcessWords() is called again in the parent to extract bar 3 4.
Because getProcessWords() ended on a NULL and there exists a pipe to read 
from, forkAndExecRD() is called to exec bar. Within
forkAndExecRD(), handleRedirects() and replaceQuotes() are called but have no 
effect. forkAndExecRD() calls closeAllPipes() before exec().

Lastly, the parent calls closeAllPipes().

>> A7: Briefly describe your approch for reaping child processes. When do
>> you reap, and how much do you reap at a time? Would it be possible to
>> reap children earlier than your current implementation and, if so,
>> what situations might that benefit?

When getProcessWords() returns indicating it hit a NULL, the parent
processes knows the end of the line has been hit and no more processes
will be created. With this, in main(), the parent waits for all children
and reaps them using while (wait(NULL) != -1).

We experimented with reaping one child at a time within calls to any of
the forkAndExec function variations, but this resulted in the parent
process never ending. The only variation it would work within is the
plain forkAndExec(), which is only used when one child process is
created, meaning there are no pipes. So, reaping earlier is possible
only in this situation.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A8: Does any aspect of our shell require multithreading or related
>> synchronization primitives (locks, semaphores)? Is the bash shell
>> (http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/bash.git/) multithreaded?
>> What did you grep to determine the answer?

Our shell does not require multithreading or synchronization primitives. 
Each command is executed in a separate child process via fork(), and 
parent-child coordination is handled using wait() or waitpid(), so 
 no threads or shared memory regions are accessed concurrently

We looked at whether the official Bash shell is multithreaded by 
checking its source with: 

grep -r pthread_create .
grep -r pthread_mutex .

Both returned no results that supports that Bash operates as a 
single-threaded shell. The visible calls only appear in configure, 
config.log, and m4 scripts (used for build testing), not in 
Bash's actual runtime logic. 
 
>> A9: Develop a new test, not covered by existing tests. Provide the 
>> code implementing that test. When possible, follow the format of 
>> existing tests. Explain what functionality it tests and how it goes 
>> beyond the provided tests.

We implemented test-9-double-quotes.sh, a test to check both single 
and double quote handling in our shell implementation. We were
having issues with commands with multiple quotes that were not caught
by the original tests.
